# gRPC_example
This tutorial covers how to create a simple Python application that uses the gRPC Protocol.  
It's recommended that you start with **protoc_test_drive**, to get a hang of gRPC, and the code that it outputs.  
After, go through the **toy_example** to get an idea of how to make a simple client-server app using gRPC.  
Lastly, you can go through the **docker_grpc_example**. In this example, you will be running the server and client in
different containers, similar to what microservices are like. The client will use gRPC to communicate with the server.
However, both will be in their own separate containers.
